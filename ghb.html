        <h1>Lyrics </h1>
        <pre>
            One, two, three
            Wait, is this the song with the drums?
            <br>
            I met a guy in the summer and I left him in the spring
            He argued with me about everything
            He had an ego and a temper and a wandering eye
            He said he's six-foot-two, and I'm like, "Dude, nice try"
            But he was so much fun and he had such weird friends
            And he would take us out to parties and the night would never end
            Another song, another club, another bar, another dance
            And when he said something wrong, he'd just fly me to France
            So I miss him some nights when I'm feeling depressed
            'Til I remember every time he made a pass on my friend
            Do I love him? Do I hate him? I guess it's up and down
            If I had to choose, I would say right now
            <br>
            I wanna get him back
            I wanna make him really jealous, wanna make him feel bad
            Oh, I wanna get him back
            'Cause then again, I really miss him, and it makes me real sad
            Oh, I want sweet revenge
            And I want him again
            I want to get him back, back, back
            <br>
            So I write him all these letters and I throw them in the trash
            'Cause I miss the way he kisses and the way he made me laugh
            Yeah, I pour my little heart out, but as I'm hitting "Send"
            I picture all the faces of my disappointed friends
            Because everyone knew all of the shit that he'd do
            He said I was the only girl but that just wasn't the truth
            And when I told him how he hurt me, he'd tell me I was trippin'
            But I am my father's daughter, so maybe I could fix him
            <br>
            I wanna get him back
            I wanna make him really jealous, wanna make him feel bad
            Oh, I wanna get him back
            'Cause then again, I really miss him, and it makes me real sad
            Oh, I want sweet revenge
            And I want him again
            I want to get him back (and then? And then)
            I want to get him back, back, back
            <br>
            I wanna key his car (I want to get him back)
            I wanna make him lunch (but then I, I want to get him back)
            I wanna break his heart (but then I, I want to get him back)
            And be the one to stitch it up (but then I, I want to get him back)
            Wanna kiss his face (but then I, I want to get him back)
            With an uppercut (but then I, I want to get him back)
            I wanna meet his mom (but then I, I want to get him back)
            Just to tell her her son sucks (but then I, I want to get him back)
            <br>
            Oh, I wanna key his car (I want to get him back)
            I wanna make him lunch
            I wanna break his heart (but then I, I want to get him back)
            Stitch it right back up
            I wanna kiss his face (I want to get him back)
            With an uppercut
            I wanna meet his mom (but then I, I want to get him back)
            And tell her her son sucks, yeah
            <br>
            I wanna get him back
            I wanna make him really jealous, wanna make him feel bad
            Oh, I wanna get him back
            'Cause then again I really miss him, and it makes me real sad
            Oh, I want sweet revenge
            And I want him again
            I want to get him back (and then? And then)
            I want to get him back, back, back, back
            <br>
            I'll get him, I'll get him, I'll get him, I'll get him back
            Get him back, come on, come on
            I'm gonna get him so good, he won't even know what hit him
            He's gonna love me and hate me at the same time
            Get him back, girl, you better get him back
            I don't know I got him good, I got him really good
