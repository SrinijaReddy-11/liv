        <h1>Lyrics </h1>
        <pre>La-da-da-da, da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
            La-da-da-da, da-da-da
            <br>
            If I told you how much I think about her
            You'd think I was in love
            And if you knew how much I looked at her pictures
            You would think we're best friends
            <br>
            'Cause I know her star sign, I know her blood type
            I've seen every movie she's been in and, oh god, she's beautiful
            And I know you loved her, and I know I'm butthurt
            But I can't help it, no, I can't help it
            <br>
            I'm so obsessed with your ex (uh-huh)
            I know she's been asleep on my side of your bed
            And I can feel it
            I'm starin' at her like I wanna get hurt
            And I remember every detail you have ever told me
            So be careful, baby
            <br>
            I'm so obsessed with your ex (ah)
            Yeah, I'm so obsessed with your ex (ah)
            La-da-da-da, da-da-da
            <br>
            She's got those lips, she's got those hips
            The life of every fuckin' party
            She's talented, she's good with kids
            She even speaks kindly about me, ha-huh
            <br>
            And I know you love me, and I know it's crazy
            But every time you call my name, I think you mistake me for her
            You both have moved on, you don't even talk
            But I can't help it, I got issues, I can't help it, baby
            <br>
            I'm so obsessed with your ex
            I know she's been asleep on my side in your bed
            And I can feel it
            I'm starin' at her like I wanna get hurt
            And I remember every detail you have ever told me
            So be careful, baby
            <br>
            I'm so obsessed with your ex (ah)
            Yeah, I'm so obsessed with your ex (ah)
            <br>
            Is she friends with your friends? Is she good in bed?
            Do you think about her? No, I'm fine, it doesn't matter, tell me
            Is she easy-going? Never controlling?
            Well-traveled? Well-read? Oh god, she makes me so upset
            <br>
            I'm so obsessed with your ex (ah)
            She's been asleep on my side in your bed (ah, whoa)
            I'm so obsessed with your ex (god, she makes me so upset, ah)
            I'm so obsessed with your, with your ex
