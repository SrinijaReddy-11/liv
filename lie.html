        <h1>Lyrics </h1>
        <pre>I told my friends you were the one
            After I'd known you, like, a month
            And then, you kissed some girl from high school
            <br>
            And I stayed in bed for, like, a week
            When you said space was what you need
            Waited by my phone like a goddamn fool
            <br>
            And now, it don't mean a thing
            God, love's fuckin' embarrassing
            Just watch as I crucify myself
            <br>
            For some weird second string
            Loser who's not worth mentioning
            My God, love's embarrassing as hell
            <br>
            And I consoled you while you cried
            Over your ex-girlfriend's new guy
            My God, how could I be so stupid?
            <br>
            You found a new version of me
            And I damn near started World War III
            Jesus, what was I even doin'?
            <br>
            'Cause now, it don't mean a thing
            God, love's fuckin' embarrassing
            Just watch as I crucify myself
            <br>
            For some weird second string
            Loser who's not worth mentioning
            My God, love's embarrassing as hell
            <br>
            I give up, give up, I give up everything
            I placed my bets and it's not worth anything
            I give up, give up, but I keep comin' back for more
            <br>
            Yeah, it don't mean a thing
            God, love's fuckin' embarrassing
            Just watch as I crucify myself, hey, hey, hey
            <br>
            For some weird second-string
            Loser who's not worth mentioning
            My God, love's embarrassing as hell, yeah, yeah
            <br>
            I give up (ah), give up, I'll give up everything (ah-ha)
            I'm plannin' out my wedding with some guy I'm never marryin'
            I'm givin' up, I'm givin' up, but I keep comin' back for more
