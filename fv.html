        <h1>Lyrics </h1>
        <pre>Know that I loved you so bad
            I let you treat me like that
            I was your willing accomplice, honey
            <br>
            And I watched as you fled the scene
            Doe-eyed as you buried me
            One heart broke, four hands bloody
            <br>
            Those things I did
            Just so I could call you mine
            The things you did
            Well, I hope I was your favorite crime
            <br>
            You used me as an alibi
            I crossed my heart as you crossed the line
            And I defended you to all my friends
            <br>
            And now, every time a siren sounds
            I wonder if you're around
            'Cause you know that I'd do it all again
            <br>
            All the things I did
            Just so I could call you mine
            The things you did
            Well, I hope I was your favorite crime
            <br>
            It's bittersweet to think about the damage that we do
            'Cause I was going down, but I was doing it with you
            Yeah, everything we broke, and all the trouble that we made
            But I say that I hate you with a smile on my face
            <br>
            Oh, look what we became
            <br>
            All the things I did
            Just so I could call you mine
            All the things you did
            Well, I hope I was your favorite crime
            <br>
            Your favorite crime
            Your favorite crime
            'Cause baby, you were mine
        </pre>
