        <h1>Lyrics </h1>
        <pre>
            I kinda wanna throw my phone across the room
            'Cause all I see are girls too good to be true
            With paper-white teeth and perfect bodies
            Wish I didn't care
            <br>
            I know their beauty's not my lack
            But it feels like that weight is on my back
            And I can't let it go
            <br>
            Co-comparison is killing me slowly
            I think, I think too much
            'Bout kids who don't know me
            I'm so sick of myself
            I'd rather be, rather be
            Anyone, anyone else
            My jealousy, jealousy
            Started following me (he-he-he, he-he)
            Started following me (he-he-he, he-he)
            <br>
            And I see everyone getting all the things I want
            And I'm happy for them, but then again, I'm not
            Just cool vintage clothes and vacation photos
            I can't stand it, oh, God, I sound crazy
            <br>
            Their win is not my loss
            I know it's true
            But I can't help getting caught up in it all
            <br>
            Co-co-comparison is killing me slowly
            I think, I think too much
            'Bout kids who don't know me
            I'm so sick of myself
            I'd rather be, rather be
            Anyone, anyone else
            My jealousy, jealousy (yeah)
            <br>
            All your friends are so cool, you go out every night
            In your daddy's nice car, yeah, you're living the life
            Got a pretty face, a pretty boyfriend too
            I wanna be you so bad, and I don't even know you
            All I see is what I should be
            Happier, prettier, jealousy, jealousy
            All I see is what I should be
            I'm losing it, all I get's, jealousy, jealousy
            <br>
            Co-comparison is killing me slowly
            I think, I think too much
            'Bout kids who don't know me
            And I'm so sick of myself
            I'd rather be, rather be (oh, oh)
            Anyone, anyone else (anybody else)
            Jealousy, jealousy
            <br>
            Oh, I'm so sick of myself
            I'd rather be, rather be (oh-oh)
            Anyone, anyone else
            Jealousy, jealousy
            Started following me
