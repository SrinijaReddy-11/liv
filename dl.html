            I got my driver's license last week
            Just like we always talked about
            'Cause you were so excited for me
            To finally drive up to your house
            But today I drove through the suburbs
            Cryin' 'cause you weren't around
            <br>
            And you're probably with that blonde girl
            Who always made me doubt
            She's so much older than me
            She's everything I'm insecure about
            Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
            'Cause how could I ever love someone else?
            <br>
            And I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
            And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
            Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
            'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
            <br>
            And all my friends are tired
            Of hearing how much I miss you, but
            I kinda feel sorry for them
            'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do, yeah
            Today I drove through the suburbs
            And pictured I was driving home to you
            <br>
            And I know we weren't perfect
            But I've never felt this way for no one, oh
            And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
            I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
            'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
            <br>
            Red lights, stop signs
            I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
            Can't drive past the places we used to go to
            'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
            Sidewalks we crossed
            I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
            Over all the noise
            God, I'm so blue, know we're through
            But I still fuckin' love you, babe (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
            <br>
            I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
            And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
            'Cause you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
            'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
            Yeah, you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
