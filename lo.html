        <h1>Lyrics </h1>
        <pre>
            Master manipulator
            God, you're so good at what you do
            Come for me like a savior
            And I'd put myself through hell for you
            Hear all the rumors lately
            That you always denied
            <br>
            And I fell for you like water
            Falls from the February sky
            But now the current's stronger
            No, I couldn't get out if I tried
            But you convinced me, baby
            It was all in my mind
            <br>
            And now you got me thinking
            Two plus two equals five
            And I'm the love of your life
            'Cause if rain don't pour and sun don't shine
            Then changing you is possible
            No, love is never logical
            <br>
            You built a giant castle
            With walls so high I couldn't see
            The way it all unraveled
            And all the things you did to me
            You lied, you lied, you lied
            <br>
            Oh, and now you got me thinking
            Two plus two equals five
            And I'm the love of your life
            'Cause if rain don't pour and sun don't shine
            Then changing you is possible
            I guess love is never logical
            <br>
            The sky is green, the grass is red and
            You mean all those words you said
            I'm sure that girl is really your friend
            Problems are all solvable
            'Cause loving you is loving every
            <br>
            Argument you held over my head
            Brought up the girls you could have instead
            Said I was too young, I was too soft
            Can't take a joke, can't get you off
            Oh, why do I do this?
            <br>
            I look so stupid thinking
            Two plus two equals five
            And I'm the love of your life
            'Cause if rain don't pour and sun don't shine
            Then changing you is possible
            No, love is never logical
            <br>
            Logical, logical
            Love is never logical
            I know I'm half responsible
            And that makes me feel horrible
            <br>
            Oh, logical, logical
            Love is never logical
            I know I could've stopped it all
            God, why didn't I stop it all?
            <br>
            Oh, logical, logical
            Love is never logical
            I know I'm half responsible
            And that makes me feel horrible
            <br>
            Oh, logical, logical
            Love is never logical
            I know I could've stopped it all
            God, why didn't I stop it all?
