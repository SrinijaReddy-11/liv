        <h1>Lyrics </h1>
        <pre>
            We broke up a month ago
            Your friends are mine, you know, I know
            You've moved on, found someone new
            One more girl who brings out the better in you
            <br>
            And I thought my heart was detached
            From all the sunlight of our past
            But she's so sweet, she's so pretty
            Does she mean you forgot about me?
            <br>
            Oh, I hope you're happy
            But not like how you were with me
            I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go
            So find someone great, but don't find no one better
            I hope you're happy, but don't be happier
            <br>
            And do you tell her she's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen?
            An eternal love bullshit you know you'll never mean
            Remember when I believed you meant it when you said it first to me?
            <br>
            And now I'm pickin' her apart
            Like cuttin' her down will make you miss my wretched heart
            But she's beautiful, she looks kind
            She probably gives you butterflies
            <br>
            I hope you're happy
            But not like how you were with me
            I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go
            So find someone great but don't find no one better
            <br>
            I hope you're happy
            I wish you all the best, really
            Say you love her, baby, just not like you loved me
            And think of me fondly when your hands are on her
            I hope you're happy, but don't be happier
            <br>
            Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
            <br>
            Ooh-ooh
            <br>
            I hope you're happy
            Just not like how you were with me
            I'm selfish, I know, can't let you go
            So find someone great, but don't find no one better
            I hope you're happy, but don't be happier
