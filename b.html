        <h1>Lyrics </h1>
        <pre>
            I want it to be, like, messy
            <br>
            I'm so insecure, I think
            That I'll die before I drink
            And I'm so caught up in the news
            Of who likes me, and who hates you
            And I'm so tired that I might
            Quit my job, start a new life
            And they'd all be so disappointed
            'Cause, who am I, if not exploited?
            <br>
            And I'm so sick of 17
            Where's my fucking teenage dream?
            If someone tells me one more time
            "Enjoy your youth, " I'm gonna cry
            And I don't stick up for myself
            I'm anxious and nothing can help
            And I wish I'd done this before
            And I wish people liked me more
            <br>
            All I did was try my best
            This the kind of thanks I get?
            Unrelentlessly upset (ah, ah, ah)
            They say these are the golden years
            But I wish I could disappear
            Ego crush is so severe
            God, it's brutal out here
            <br>
            I feel like no one wants me
            And I hate the way I'm perceived
            I only have two real friends
            And lately, I'm a nervous wreck
            'Cause I love people I don't like
            And I hate every song I write
            And I'm not cool and I'm not smart
            And I can't even parallel park
            <br>
            All I did was try my best
            This the kind of thanks I get?
            Unrelentlessly upset (ah, ah, ah)
            They say these are the golden years
            But I wish I could disappear
            Ego crush is so severe
            God, it's brutal out here
            <br>
            Got a broken ego, broken heart (it's brutal out here, it's brutal out here)
            And God, I don't even know where to start
