            Hey
            <br>
            Haven't heard from you in a couple of months
            But I'm out right now, and I'm all fucked up
            And you're callin' my phone, you're all alone
            And I'm sensin' some undertone
            <br>
            And I'm right here with all my friends
            But you're sendin' me your new address
            And I know we're done, I know we're through
            But, God, when I look at you
            <br>
            My brain goes, "Ah"
            Can't hear my thoughts (I cannot hear my thoughts)
            Like blah-blah-blah (blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah)
            Should probably not
            I should probably, probably not
            I should probably, probably not
            <br>
            Seein' you tonight, it's a bad idea, right?
            Seein' you tonight, it's a bad idea, right?
            Seein' you tonight, it's a bad idea, right?
            Seein' you tonight, fuck it, it's fine
            <br>
            Yes, I know that he's my ex, but can't two people reconnect?
            "I only see him as a friend, " the biggest lie I ever said
            Oh, yes, I know that he's my ex, but can't two people reconnect?
            I only see him as a friend, I just tripped and fell into his bed
            <br>
            Now I'm gettin' in the car, wreckin' all my plans
            I know I should stop-, but I can't
            And I told my friends I was asleep
            But I never said where or in whose sheets
            <br>
            And I pull up to your place, on the second floor
            And you're standin', smiling at the door
            And I'm sure I've seen much hotter men
            But I really can't remember when
            <br>
            My brain goes, "Ah"
            Can't hear my thoughts (I cannot hear my thoughts)
            Like blah-blah-blah (blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah)
            Should probably not
            I should probably, probably not
            I should probably, probably not
            <br>
            Seein' you tonight, it's a bad idea, right?
            Seein' you tonight, it's a bad idea, right?
            Seein' you tonight, it's a bad idea, right?
            Seein' you tonight, fuck it, it's fine

            Thoughts
            Blah
            Thoughts
            Blah
