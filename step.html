        <h1>Lyrics </h1>
        <pre>
            Called you on the phone today
            Just to ask you how you were
            All I did was speak normally
            Somehow I still struck a nerve
            <br>
            You got me fucked up in the head, boy
            Never doubted myself so much
            Like, am I pretty? Am I fun, boy?
            I hate that I give you power over that kind of stuff
            <br>
            'Cause it's always one step forward and three steps back
            I'm the love of your life until I make you mad
            It's always one step forward and three steps back
            Do you love me, want me, hate me? Boy, I don't understand
            No, I don't understand
            <br>
            And maybe in some masochistic way
            I kinda find it all exciting
            Like, which lover will I get today?
            Will you walk me to the door or send me home cryin'?
            <br>
            It's one step forward and three steps back
            I'm the love of your life until I make you mad
            It's always one step forward and three steps back
            Do you love me, want me, hate me? Boy, I don't understand
            <br>
            No, it's back and forth, did I say something wrong?
            It's back and forth, goin' over everything I said
            It's back and forth, did I do something wrong?
            It's back and forth, maybe this is all your fault
            <br>
            Instead it's one step forward and three steps back
            And I'd leave you, but the roller coaster is all I've ever had
            Yeah, it's one step forward and three steps back
            Do you love me, want me, hate me? Boy
            I don't understand
            No, I don't understand
