        <h1>Lyrics </h1>
        <pre>
            I am light as a feather
            I'm as stiff as a board
            I pay attention to things that most people ignore
            And I'm alright with the movies that make jokes 'bout senseless cruelty
            That's for sure
            And I am built like a mother and a total machine
            I feel for your every little issue
            I know just what you mean
            And I make light of the darkness
            I've got sun in my motherfucking pocket, best believe
            Yeah, you know me, I
            <br>
            Forgive and I forget
            I know my age and I act like it
            Got what you can't resist
            I'm a perfect all-American
            <br>
            I am light as a feather
            I'm as fresh as the air
            Coca-Cola bottles that I only use to curl my hair
            I got class and integrity
            Just like a goddamn Kennedy
            I swear
            With love to spare, I
            <br>
            Forgive and I forget
            I know my age and I act like it
            Got what you can't resist
            I'm a perfect all-American bitch
            With perfect all-American lips
            And perfect all-American hips
            I know my place, I know my place, and this is it
            <br>
            I don't get angry when I'm pissed
            I'm the eternal optimist
            I scream inside to deal with it
            Like, "Ah"
            Like, "Ah" (oh my fucking God)
            <br>
            All the time
            I'm grateful all the time
            I'm sexy and I'm kind
            I'm pretty when I cry
            Oh, all the time
            I'm grateful all the fucking time
            I'm sexy and I'm kind
            I'm pretty when I cry
        </pre>
