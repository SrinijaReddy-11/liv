        <h1>Lyrics </h1>
        <pre>
            Car rides to Malibu
            Strawberry ice cream
            One spoon for two
            And trading jackets
            Laughing 'bout how small it looks on you
            (Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha)
            Watching reruns of Glee
            Being annoying
            Singing in harmony
            I bet she's bragging
            To all her friends, saying you're so unique, hmm
            <br>
            So when you gonna tell her
            That we did that, too?
            She thinks it's special
            But it's all reused
            That was our place, I found it first
            I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you
            <br>
            Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
            Do you get déjà vu? (Ah), hmm
            Do you get déjà vu, huh?
            <br>
            Do you call her
            Almost say my name?
            'Cause let's be honest
            We kinda do sound the same
            Another actress
            I hate to think that I was just your type
            <br>
            I'll bet that she knows Billy Joel
            'Cause you played her "Uptown Girl"
            You're singing it together
            Now I bet you even tell her
            How you love her
            In between the chorus and the verse (ooh) (I love you)
            <br>
            So when you gonna tell her
            That we did that, too?
            She thinks it's special
            But it's all reused
            That was the show we talked about
            Played you the song she's singing now when she's with you
            <br>
            Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
            Do you get déjà vu? Oh
            Do you get déjà vu?
            <br>
            Strawberry ice cream in Malibu
            Don't act like we didn't do that shit, too
            You're trading jackets like we used to do
            (Yeah, everything is all reused)
            Play her piano, but she doesn't know (oh, oh)
            That I was the one who taught you Billy Joel (oh)
            A different girl now, but there's nothing new
            (I know you get déjà vu)
