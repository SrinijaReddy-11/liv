        <h1>Lyrics </h1>
        <pre>
            I knew a boy once, when I was small
            A tow-head blonde, with eyes of salt
            He played the drum in the marching band
            His parents cared more about the Bible
            Than being good to their own child
            He wore long sleeves 'cause of his dad
            <br>
            And somehow, we fell out of touch
            Hope he took his bad deal and made a royal flush
            Don't know if I'll see you again someday
            But if you're out there, I hope that you're okay
            <br>
            My middle school friend grew up alone
            She raised her brothers on her own
            Her parents hated who she loved
            She couldn't wait to go to college
            She was tired 'cause she was brought
            Into a world where family was merely blood
            <br>
            Does she know how proud I am she was created
            With the courage to unlearn all of their hatred
            We don't talk much but I just gotta say
            "I miss you, and I hope that you're okay"
            <br>
            Address the letters, to the holes in my butterfly wings
            Nothing's forever, nothing is as good as it seems
            And when the clouds are ironed out
            And the monsters creep into your house
            And every door is hard to close
            <br>
            Well, I hope you know how proud I am you were created
            With the courage to unlearn all of their hatred
            God, I hope that you're happier today
            'Cause I love you, and I hope that you're okay
        </pre>
