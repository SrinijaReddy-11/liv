        <h1>Lyrics </h1>
        <pre>
            Bought a bunch of makeup, tryna cover up my face
            I started to skip lunch, stopped eating cake on birthdays
            Bought a new prescription to try and stay calm
            'Cause there's always something missing
            There's always something in the mirror that I think looks wrong
            <br>
            When pretty isn't pretty enough, what do you do?
            And everybody's keeping it up, so you think it's you
            I could change up my body and change up my face
            I could try every lipstick in every shade
            But I'd always feel the same
            'Cause pretty isn't pretty enough anyway
            <br>
            You can win the battle, but you'll never win the war
            You fix the things you hated, and you'd still feel so insecure
            And I try to ignore it, but it's everything I see
            It's on the poster on the wall, it's in the shitty magazines
            It's in my phone, it's in my head, it's in the boys I bring to bed
            It's all around, it's all the time, I don't know why I even try
            <br>
            When pretty isn't pretty enough, what do you do?
            And everybody's keeping it up, so you think it's you
            I could change up my body and change up my face
            I could try every lipstick in every shade
            But I'd always feel the same
            'Cause pretty isn't pretty enough
            <br>
            And I bought all the clothes that they told me to buy
            I chased some dumb ideal my whole fucking life
            And none of it matters, and none of it ends
            You just feel like shit over and over again
            <br>
            No, it'll never change
            Pretty isn't pretty enough, mm
            Everybody's keeping it up, oh
            Pretty isn't pretty enough
            Pretty isn't-
