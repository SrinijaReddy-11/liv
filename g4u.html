        <pre>
            Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
            You found a new girl, and it only took a couple weeks
            Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world? (World)
            And good for you, I guess that you've been working on yourself
            I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
            Now you can be a better man for your brand-new girl
            <br>
            Well, good for you, you look happy and healthy
            Not me, if you ever cared to ask
            Good for you, you're doing great out there without me, baby
            God, I wish that I could do that
            <br>
            I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
            Crying on the floor of my bathroom
            But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
            But I guess good for you
            <br>
            Well, good for you, I guess you're gettin' everything you want (ah)
            You bought a new car and your career's really takin' off (ah)
            It's like we never even happened, baby, what the fuck is up with that? (Ha)
            And good for you, it's like you never even met me
            Remember when you swore to God I was the only
            Person who ever got you? Well, screw that and screw you
            You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do
            <br>
            Well, good for you, you look happy and healthy
            Not me, if you ever cared to ask
            Good for you, you're doing great out there without me, baby
            God, I wish that I could do that
            <br>
            I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
            Crying on the floor of my bathroom
            But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
            But I guess good for you
            <br>
            Ah-ah-ah-ah
            Ah-ah-ah-ah
            <br>
            Maybe I'm too emotional
            But your apathy is like a wound in salt
            Maybe I'm too emotional
            Or maybe you never cared at all
            Maybe I'm too emotional
            Your apathy is like a wound in salt
            Maybe I'm too emotional
            Or maybe you never cared at all
            <br>
            Well, good for you, you look happy and healthy
            Not me, if you ever cared to ask
            Good for you, you're doing great out there without me, baby
            Like a damn sociopath
            <br>
            I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
            Crying on the floor of my bathroom
            But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
            But I guess good for you
            <br>
            Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
