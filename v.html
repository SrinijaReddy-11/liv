        <h1>Lyrics </h1>
        <pre>
            Hate to give the satisfaction, asking how you're doing now
            How's the castle built off people you pretend to care about?
            Just what you wanted
            Look at you, cool guy, you got it
            I see the parties and the diamonds sometimes when I close my eyes
            Six months of torture you sold as some forbidden paradise
            I loved you truly
            Gotta laugh at the stupidity
            <Bbr></Bbr>
            'Cause I've made some real big mistakes
            But you make the worst one look fine
            I should've known it was strange
            You only come out at night
            I used to think I was smart
            But you made me look so naive
            The way you sold me for parts
            As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
            Bloodsucker, famefucker
            Bleedin' me dry, like a goddamn vampire
            <br>
            And every girl I ever talked to told me you were bad, bad news
            You called them crazy, God, I hate the way I called them crazy too
            You're so convincing
            How do you lie without flinching? (How do you lie, how do you lie, how do you lie?)
            Ooh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked-up little thrill
            Can't figure out just how you do it, and God knows I never will
            Went for me, and not her
            'Cause girls your age know better
            <br>
            I've made some real big mistakes
            But you make the worst one look fine
            I should've known it was strange
            You only come out at night
            I used to think I was smart
            But you've made me look so naive
            The way you sold me for parts
            As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
            Bloodsucker, famefucker
            Bleedin' me dry, like a goddamn vampire
            <br>
            You said it was true love, but wouldn't that be hard?
            You can't love anyone, 'cause that would mean you had a heart
            I tried you help you out, now I know that I can't
            'Cause how you think's the kind of thing I'll never understand
            <br>
            I've made some real big mistakes
            But you make the worst one look fine
            I should've known it was strange
            You only come out at night
            I used to think I was smart
            But you made me look so naive
            The way you sold me for parts
            As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
            Bloodsucker, famefucker
            Bleedin' me dry, like a goddamn vampire
