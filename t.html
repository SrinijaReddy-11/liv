        <h1>Lyrics </h1>
        <pre>
            Ooh-ooh-ooh
            Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
            <br>
            Brown guilty eyes and little white lies
            Yeah, I played dumb but I always knew
            That you'd talk to her, maybe did even worse
            I kept quiet so I could keep you
            <br>
            And ain't it funny
            How you ran to her
            The second that we called it quits?
            <br>
            And ain't it funny
            How you said you were friends?
            Now it sure as hell don't look like it
            <br>
            You betrayed me
            And I know that you'll never feel sorry
            For the way I hurt, yeah
            You'd talk to her
            When we were together
            Loved you at your worst
            But that didn't matter
            <br>
            It took you two weeks
            To go off and date her
            Guess you didn't cheat
            But you're still a traitor
            <br>
            Now you bring her around
            Just to shut me down
            Show her off like she's a new trophy
            <br>
            And I know if you were true
            There's no damn way that you
            Could fall in love with somebody that quickly
            <br>
            Ain't it funny
            All the twisted games
            All the questions you used to avoid?
            <br>
            Ain't it funny?
            Remember I brought her up
            And you told me I was paranoid
            <br>
            You betrayed me
            And I know that you'll never feel sorry
            For the way I hurt, yeah
            You'd talk to her
            When we were together
            Loved you at your worst
            But that didn't matter
            <br>
            It took you two weeks
            To go off and date her
            Guess you didn't cheat
            But you're still a traitor
            <br>
            God, I wish that you had thought this through
            Before I went and fell in love with you
            (Ah-ah-ah)
            When she's sleeping in the bed we made
            Don't you dare forget about the way
            <br>
            You betrayed me
            'Cause I know that you'll never feel sorry
            For the way I hurt, yeah
            You'd talk to her
            When we were together
            You gave me your word
            But that didn't matter
            <br>
            It took you two weeks
            To go off and date her
            Guess you didn't cheat
            But you're still
            You're still a traitor (ah-ah-ah)
            Yeah, you're still a traitor
            <br>
            Ooh-ooh-ooh
            God, I wish that you had thought this through
            Before I went and fell in love with you
