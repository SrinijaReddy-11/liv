        <h1>Lyrics </h1>
        <pre>
            Lacy, oh, Lacy, skin like puff pastry
            Aren't you the sweetest thing on this side of hell?
            Dear angel Lacy, eyes white as daisies
            Did I ever tell you that I'm not doing well?
            <br>
            Ooh, I care, I care, I care
            Like perfume that you wear
            I linger all the time
            Watchin', hidden in plain sight
            Ooh, I try, I try, I try
            But it takes over my life
            I see you everywhere
            The sweetest torture one could bear
            <br>
            Smart sexy Lacy, I'm losing it lately
            I feel your compliments like bullets on skin
            Dazzling starlet, Bardot reincarnate
            Well, aren't you the greatest thing to ever exist?
            <br>
            Ooh, I care, I care, I care
            Like ribbons in your hair
            My stomach's all in knots
            You got the one thing that I want
            Ooh, I try, I try, I try
            Try to rationalize
            People are people
            But it's like you're made of angel dust
            <br>
            Lacy, oh, Lacy, it's like you're out to get me
            You poison every little thing that I do
            Lacy, oh, Lacy, I just loathe you lately
            And I despise my jealous eyes and how hard they fell for you
            Yeah, I despise my rotten mind and how much it worships you
