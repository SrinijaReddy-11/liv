        <h1>Lyrics </h1>
        <pre>
            Cat got my tongue, and I don't think I get along with anyone
            Blood runnin' cold, I'm on the outside of the greatest inside joke
            And I hate all my clothes, feels like my skin doesn't fit right over my bones
            So I guess I should go, the party's done, and I'm no fun, I know, I know
            I know, I know
            <br>
            I broke a glass, I tripped and fell, I told secrets I shouldn't tell
            I stumbled over all my words, I made it weird, I made it worse
            Each time I step outside, it's social suicide
            Social suicide, wanna curl up and die, it's social suicide (ah, ah, ah)
            <br>
            I laughed at the wrong time, sat with the wrong guy (uh-huh)
            Searchin', "How to start a conversation?" on a website (how to flirt?)
            I talked to this hot guy, swore I was his type
            Guess that he was makin' out with boys, like, the whole night (oh)
            Everythin' I do is tragic (oh), every guy I like is gay (oh)
            The mornin' after, I panic (oh), oh, God, what did I say? (Oh, oh, oh)
            <br>
            I broke a glass, I tripped and fell, I told secrets I shouldn't tell
            I stumbled over all my words, I made it weird, I made it worse
            Each time I step outside, it's social suicide
            It's social suicide, wanna curl up and die
            It's social suicide, yeah, when I'm alone, I'm fine
            But don't let me out at night, it's social suicide, it's social suicide
            <br>
            Ah, ah, ah
            Ah, ah, ah
            <br>
            I broke a glass, tripped and fell, told secrets I shouldn't tell
            Stumbled over all my words, made it weird, then made it worse
            Each day that I'm alive, it's social suicide
            <br>
            It's social suicide, wanna curl up and die, it's social suicide
            It's social suicide, don't let me out at night
            I'm shocked I'm still alive, it's social suicide (ah, ah, ah)
            <br>
            Thought your mom was your wife (ah)
            Called you the wrong name twice (ah)
            Can't think of a third line (ah), la-la-la-la-la-la (ah)
            La-la-la-la-la-la (ah), la-la-la-la-la-la (ah)
            La-la-la-la-la-la, ugh
