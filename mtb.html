        <h1>Lyrics </h1>
        <pre>
            Want it, so I got it, did it, so it's done
            Another thing I ruined I used to do for fun
            Another piece of plastic I could just throw away
            Another conversation with nothing good to say
            <br>
            I thought it, so I said it, took it 'cause I can
            Another day pretendin' I'm older than I am
            Another perfect moment that doesn't feel like mine
            Another thing I forced to be a sign
            <br>
            Well, sometimes I feel like I don't wanna be where I am
            Gettin' drunk at a club with my fair-weather friends
            Push away all the people who know me the best
            But it's me who's been making the bed
            <br>
            I'm so tired of bein' the girl that I am
            Every good thing has turned into something I dread
            And I'm playin' the victim so well in my head
            But it's me who's been making the bed
            <br>
            Me who's been making the bed
            Pull the sheets over my head
            Making the bed
            <br>
            And every night, I wake up from this one recurrin' dream
            Where I'm drivin' through the city and the brakes go out on me
            I can't stop at the red light, I can't swerve off the road
            I read somewhere it's 'cause my life feels so out of control
            <br>
            And I tell someone I love them just as a distraction
            They tell me that they love me like I'm some tourist attraction
            They're changin' my machinery and I just let it happen
            I got the things I wanted, it's just not what I imagined
            <br>
            Well, sometimes I feel like I don't wanna be where I am
            Gettin' drunk at a club with my fair weather friends
            Push away all the people who know me the best
            But it's me who's been making the bed
            <br>
            I'm so tired of bein' the girl that I am
            Every good thing has turned into something I dread
            And I'm playin' the victim so well in my head
            But it's me who's been making the bed
            <br>
            Me who's been making the bed
            Pull the sheets over my head
            Making the bed
            <br>
            Sometimes I feel like I don't wanna be where I am
            Countin' all of the beautiful things I regret
            But it's me who's been making the bed
            Me who's been making the bed
            Pull the sheets over my head
            Making a bed, oh-oh
